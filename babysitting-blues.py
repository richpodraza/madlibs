Last weekend I babysat {female_celebrity} while her parents went to a(n) {type_of_music} concert. They told me to feed her {something_gross} for dinner and put her to bed. But as soon as they left, she {past_tense_verb} over a(n) {adjective} {noun} and began {ing_verb} toys everywhere. She even {past_tense_verb2} on the walls with {adjective2} {plural_noun}! Then she disappeared, and the {noun2} {past_tense_verb3}. I opened the door to find a(n) {job} holding {large_number} {plural_noun2} of {food} the girl had naughtily ordered. Finally, I found her hiding under the {furniture}. Together we {adverb} {past_tense_verb4} the house and brushed her {noun3}. When her parents returned, she was fast asleep. Who says {ing_verb2} is easy?
